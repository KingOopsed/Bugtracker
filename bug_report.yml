        Describe precisely how to reproduce the bug so we can fix it or confirm its existence:
        - Which commands to use? Which NPC to teleport to?
        - Do we need to have debug flags on Cmake?
        - Do we need to look at the console while the bug happens?
        - Other steps
        - Use the ingame commands to identify the unique GUID of an ore/herb/npc:    .npc info  /  .gobject near
